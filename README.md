# Ably_Sandbox

A local Flask web app that visualizes synthetically generated sensor data from the lap_time and MPHSensor scripts

You will need to input your Ably API key into the scripts in order to operationalize this application

You can run the lap_time and MPHSensor scripts in tandem. By default they include sleep and timeout functions (5 minutes), which you may want to modify.
